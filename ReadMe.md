# REACT Initial Training

## 2022 06 28 | Start

I've started the "React - The Complete guide" instruction by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. It is a course on Udemy. While I go through this course, I' will be using VSC. My work can be found here. This is not meant to be a structured project. Rather, it is a series of notes, sandboxes and mini-exercises that will help me become an incredible React Developer.
