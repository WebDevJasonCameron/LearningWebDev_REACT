# REACT Initial Training

## 2022 06 30 | State

Best thing I learned today was how useState works within your application. The instructor is very helpful in explaining why running an onclick command does not actually redraw the DOM. The site is drawn by REACT moving through the components once and then twice. However, once the site is completed, there isn't anything (in the beginning) that forces the site to redraw existing components. This is where useState comes into play. Even more interestingly, this function is a hook that first needs to be imported into your page. Then, it needs to called within your component (Function). It provides you an array of two elements. The existing state, and the state you will change too.

Today we worked through the structure of REACT. It is very different from the normal flow of HTML, CSS and JS. Yet, it is still very familiar. What is immediately nice about the workflow is the fact that you're building the page with components rather than structuring the HTML and hooking into those tags so you can have your design (CSS) or action (JS). You still get that, but it is the JS that is building the components. It's like having your own brick layer peace the site rather than having the site built and then trying to and functionality later. That is pretty clever

I've started the "React - The Complete guide" instruction by Maximilian Schwarzmuller. It is a course on Udemy. While I go through this course, I' will be using VSC. My work can be found here. This is not meant to be a structured project. Rather, it is a series of notes, sandboxes and mini-exercises that will help me become an incredible React Developer.
