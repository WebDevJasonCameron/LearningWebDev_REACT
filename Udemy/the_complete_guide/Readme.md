## 2022 12 09 | Restart

When I first started this lesson plan, I was right out of CodeUp (a six month programming boot camp). Like everyone else, I was very excited to learn React. Then I had a small oportunity to get hired with a company that used Angular. As such, I stopped and started Angular. I actually like that framework. However, I want to finish what I started. Unfortunately, its been long enough (and a lot of working on different work related projects) that I must restart this course. That's the life of I full stack dev I suppose. Always learning something new, using it, and moving on to something else.
