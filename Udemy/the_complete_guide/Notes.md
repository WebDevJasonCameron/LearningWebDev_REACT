# Notes from Udemy

## Starting a new react app

1. create a react app

```
npx create-react-app my-app-name
cd my-app
npm start
```

2. move into the folder

```
cd my-app-name
```

3. start react app server

```
npm-start
```

## To stop server

To stop server, use `command + c`

## If duplicating the blank project

Run `npm install`. It looks into the folder and downloads all the packages required for this app to run. I think I should need this because this blank_project is based on a download of the react starter app, with folders copied from the tutorial. However, if you want to build an app without being online (at first), this might be a good thing to do. Only need to do this once

It also caused some severe vulnerabilities. `npm audit` looks like if fixed things. Not sure what though...
